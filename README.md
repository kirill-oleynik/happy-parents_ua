## Project setup
1. Place project credential keys at `config/credentials/`
2. Create DB and run migrations: 
- `psql`
- `CREATE ROLE <db_username> SUPERUSER CREATEDB LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';` (`username` and `password` can be found in project credentials by running `rails credentials:edit --environment development`)
- `\q`
- `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`
